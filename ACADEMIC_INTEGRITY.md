- **Version:** Claude 4.5 Sonnet
- **Purpose:** Code development assistance, debugging, and documentation enhancement

#### **Specific Areas of AI Assistance**

**1. Code Development & Debugging**
- **Task:** Implementing statistical tests and visualization code
- **Prompts Used:**
  - "Help me implement Mann-Whitney U test for warm-up effect analysis"
  - "Debug this error in Test 3: NameError with 'combinations' import"
  - "How to fix SettingWithCopyWarning in pandas when creating categorical variables"
- **Output:** Code templates for hypothesis testing, bug fixes, import statements, and pandas operations
- **My Contribution:** Modified code to fit my specific dataset, adjusted parameters, interpreted results, validated outputs, and integrated into analysis workflow

**2. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**
- **Task:** Creating derived features and ordinal conversions
- **Prompts Used:**
  - "How to create strategy_type categories based on evergaol and castle visit patterns"
  - "Help implement ordinal conversion for run_outcome variable"
  - "Create feature engineering code for resource allocation metrics"
- **Output:** Feature engineering logic and categorization functions
- **My Contribution:** Designed the categorization logic based on my understanding of game mechanics, validated results against actual gameplay patterns, decided which features to create based on research questions

**3. Visualization Enhancement**
- **Task:** Improving plot aesthetics and readability
- **Prompts Used:**
  - "Update Plot 13 to use progression instead of binary victory metrics"
  - "How to add significance markers to hypothesis test visualizations"
- **Output:** Enhanced plotting code with better formatting and professional appearance
- **My Contribution:** Selected which visualizations to create, determined what insights to highlight, interpreted visual patterns, decided on final presentation format

**4. Documentation & README**
- **Task:** Structuring project documentation
- **Prompts Used:**
  - "Help organize README with plot placements for each section"
  - "Create requirements.txt file for Python dependencies"
  - "Write installation instructions for the project"
- **Output:** README structure templates, installation guides, and formatting suggestions
- **My Contribution:** Wrote all research questions, methodology descriptions, key findings, and interpretations. Provided all actual results and numbers. Customized templates to match my project specifics and findings.

**5. Statistical Methodology**
- **Task:** Selecting appropriate statistical tests and understanding their implementation
- **Prompts Used:**
  - "What's the best test for comparing multiple strategy groups with ordinal outcome"
  - "Should I use Bonferroni correction for post-hoc comparisons in Test 3"
  - "How to calculate effect sizes (Cohen's d) for my comparisons"
  - "Why did my fatigue test fail to reject H₀ when there's a visual decline"
- **Output:** Recommendations for statistical approaches, formulas, and explanations of results
- **My Contribution:** Made final decisions on methodology, set significance levels, interpreted all statistical results in context of gameplay, drew conclusions, and identified when results contradicted expectations

### What AI Did NOT Do

To clarify the boundaries of AI assistance, the following elements are **entirely my own work**:

- **Data Collection:** 121 runs of gameplay data manually recorded across multiple sessions  
- **Research Questions:** All 7 research questions and hypotheses formulated by me based on gaming experience  
- **Analysis Design:** Overall optimization framework and study structure  
- **Strategic Framework:** Reframing project as resource allocation optimization problem  
- **Data Interpretation:** All interpretations of statistical results and findings  
- **Domain Knowledge:** Understanding of game mechanics, strategy patterns, and optimal play  
- **Conclusions:** All actionable recommendations and key findings  
- **Critical Decisions:** Choice of variables, categorizations, and analysis approach  
- **Validation:** Checking that statistical results align with gameplay experience  
- **Feature Engineering Logic:** Deciding what features matter based on game understanding

### Methodology Transparency

**How I Used AI Responsibly:**

1. **Iterative Collaboration:** Used AI as a coding assistant, not a solution generator
2. **Understanding First:** Learned each statistical method before implementation
3. **Validation:** Verified all AI-generated code against expected outputs
4. **Customization:** Adapted all suggestions to fit my specific research questions
5. **Critical Thinking:** Questioned unexpected results and investigated discrepancies

**Example of Responsible Use:**

```
My Process for Test 1 Enhancement:
1. Identified need for fatigue analysis after reviewing initial results
2. Researched appropriate statistical methods (Mann-Whitney U, Spearman correlation)
3. Asked AI: "Create enhanced Test 1 that includes both warm-up and fatigue analysis"
4. Received code template with multiple sub-tests
5. Modified code for my specific data structure and variable names
6. Ran analysis and interpreted results independently
7. Questioned unexpected non-significant fatigue result
8. Asked AI: "Why did fatigue test fail when there's visual decline?"
9. Understood explanation about variance, sample size, and statistical power
10. Validated findings against domain knowledge (gameplay patterns)
```

### Code Attribution

Where AI assistance was used for code generation, the code has been:
- **Reviewed:** Manually checked for correctness and logic
- **Tested:** Validated against sample data and edge cases
- **Understood:** I can explain every line of code used and why it's needed
- **Adapted:** Modified to fit my specific use case and dataset structure
- **Debugged:** Fixed errors independently when they occurred

All analysis decisions, statistical interpretations, and conclusions are my independent work.
